Our goal with creating this new way of unlocking is to help protect you against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)">shoulder surfing</a>. Maybe you have kids who have perfected the art of shoulder surfing, that also likes to play with your phone when you are not looking? VaultLock is meant to try and keep these notes safe from your lovely small terrorists. <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#education">Our preliminary empirical research</a> shows that the locking mechanism protects against shoulder surfers to a better degree than the standard pin-code system.

                    <p> Empirical research was done before the development of VaultLock with the help of our prototypes. Our observational study was done with our digital prototype and the participation/empathy study was done with our native prototype. </p>

                            <p>Using observation technique to investigate desirability among potential users, the participants were asked to use the prototype and fill in a made up password, which was repeated with three different passwords, to let them get used to the idea. After the experiment, the participants were asked questions related to ease of use, practicality and whether they could see themselves using it or not.</p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Results</div>
                            <p>This showed us that the idea was desirable and was a precursor before development of VaultLock. The big factor that was important according to our users was to implement haptic feedback for each turn of the knob, which we brought with us in development.</p>

Each locking mechanism was used 5 times by each person.</p>

                            <p>Regular pin-code replicated 7/10 times. Vault lock replicated 5/10 times.</p>
                            <p> Obviously more research is nescessary due to the limited amount of time to do this research and due to the limited number of participants for the study. But we can preliminary point and say that it seems to be safer than the ordinary pin-code. However it might be because of the novelty of VaultLock and not that it is safer in practicality.</p>

                                The prototype is quite primitive and not detailed.
                                It includes only the locking mechansim, since the locking mechansim was originally suppose to be used
                                to unclock the phone. In later iterations and in the actual end product we chose to use this mechansim as a
                                way to authenticate into our app which would store the users most important notes/documents.

                                The prototype is super lightweight with the only functionality being that the cog wheel turns with the help of dragging the finger on the screen. 
                                The main reason behind making the native prototype, apart from testing the concept, 
                                was to test whether or not there would be any difference in shoulder surfing regarding this type of interaction. 
                                Further developing the native prototype there will be feedback in terms of vibrations for each number turner, 
                                snap to defined locations (1, 2, 3, 4 etc) instead of free turning and more.

                            <p>We started our project with three ideas but, due to research and time constraints we had to settle on one.
                                The first idea that was dicarded was a a method of authentication that included taps on the back of the phone. 
                                By using the gyroscope
                                on the phone we would differentiate ordinary use from taps on the back of the phone.<br><br>
                                The second idea that was discarded was a reimagining of the ordinary pin code. 
                                The user could use short or long taps on the number 
                                while dialling the pin code. We would programatically discern a long and a short tap to add another layer of security.
                                This idea was inspired by morse code.

                        <p> Below you will find the technologies that we used and learned during this project. We started with a blank slate, not knowing Android Studio, Kotlin or Figma. We would definitely recommend using Figma for prototyping, its fast and easy to pickup and can make a lot of work for you for a low effort. If you are interested in app development for Android phones we wholeheartedly would recommend using Android studio together with Google codelabs. They make sure to hold your hand through the whole process.

                                        Kotlin

                        <p>We would suggest, if you are familiar with Java, to stick with Java in android studio instead of using Kotlin. Kotlin is not hard by any measure, but our opinion is that if you know Java, it just makes more sense.</p>
